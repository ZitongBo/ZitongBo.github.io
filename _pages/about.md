I'm a four year undergraduate student from [Institute of Software](https://www.is.cas.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research interest includes real-time system, embedded AI, and reinforcement learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Ying Qiao of Beijing key Lab.

You can find my CV here: [XX's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Curriculum_Vitae.pdf).
