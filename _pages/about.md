I am a fourth-year PhD candidate from [Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://www.is.cas.cn/). My research interest includes Real-time System, Embedded AI, and Reinforcement Learning. I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Ying Qiao of Human-computer Interaction technology and intelligent information processing Laboratory.

I used to work with Prof. [Junliang Xing](https://pi.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/lab/people/jlxing/en/) at Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences. We have won third and fourth place in the CIG2017 and AIIDE2018 StarCraft AI competitions. I am a grand master-level StarCraft player and very passionate about using AI technology to play games.

I'm looking for a job opportunity. If you are interested in my research, please contact me!
